# React-UI

Frontend of Red Hat Massages management site.
The UI was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Starting the application

1. Run `npm install` to build your application
2. Start the application with `npm start`
3. To check that your application is running enter url `http://localhost:3000`

If you really want to run the client separately however, you need to correctly forward the requests to the server.

## Updating documentation

React documentation generation script is supported by the UI.
You can run `npm run docgen` to generate a new documentation [README.md](https://github.com/PSilling/rh-massages/blob/master/react-ui/docs/README.md) inside the docs folder.
For non-React files see their respective documenation inside the file.
